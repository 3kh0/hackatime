# Welcome to Hackatime

Hackatime is Hack Club's coding time tracker that helps you understand your programming habits and productivity patterns.

## What is Hackatime?

Hackatime automatically tracks the time you spend coding across different projects, languages, and editors. It's built to be compatible with the WakaTime ecosystem, so you can use existing WakaTime plugins and tools while enjoying a community-focused experience designed for Hack Club members.

## How it Works

1. **Install a WakaTime Plugin**: Add the WakaTime extension to your favorite code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, etc.)
2. **Configure Your API Key**: Get your API key from Hackatime and configure it in your editor
3. **Start Coding**: Your coding time is automatically tracked as you write code
4. **View Your Stats**: See your coding activity, most-used languages, projects, and productivity patterns on your dashboard

## Key Features

- **Automatic Time Tracking**: No need to start/stop timers - just code naturally
- **Language & Project Insights**: See which languages and projects you spend the most time on
- **Leaderboards**: Compare your coding activity with other Hack Club members
- **WakaTime Compatibility**: Use any existing WakaTime plugin or tool
- **Privacy First**: Your code content is never tracked, only metadata like file types and project names
