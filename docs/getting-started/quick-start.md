# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Hackatime in under 5 minutes! 

## What is Hackatime?

Hackatime is a **free and open source** alternative to WakaTime that automatically tracks your coding time. It works with **every WakaTime editor plugin** by simply configuring your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file to point to Hackatime's servers.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Visit [hackatime.hackclub.com](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and sign up using:
- Your Hack Club Slack account (recommended)
- Email address

## Step 2: Run Automated Setup

üöÄ **Visit the [Hackatime Setup Page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup)** - this will:

1. Auto-detect your operating system
2. Provide a copy-paste command that configures everything
3. Create your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file pointing to Hackatime
4. Send a test heartbeat to verify setup
5. Show you when it's working!

The setup page handles all configuration automatically - no manual editing required!

## Step 3: Install WakaTime Plugin

Hackatime works with **any WakaTime plugin**. Install for your editor:

### Popular Editors:
- **VS Code**: Search "WakaTime" in Extensions marketplace
- **IntelliJ/PyCharm**: Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Install "WakaTime"
- **Vim/Neovim**: Install `vim-wakatime` plugin

## Step 4: Configure Plugin to Use Hackatime

**If you used the setup page**: Your `~/.wakatime.cfg` is already configured! The WakaTime plugin will automatically use Hackatime.

**Manual configuration**: Edit `~/.wakatime.cfg`:
```ini
[settings]
api_url = https://hackatime.hackclub.com/api/hackatime/v1
api_key = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

```
